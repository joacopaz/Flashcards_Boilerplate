# Flashcards BoilerPlate

To install just run `npm install`, the package is up to date with react router dom v6 and the files correctly adapted up to October 2022.

Start the local server with `npm start`

To get the current updated version of all packages up to the date you will be using this project run the command below

```
npm i -g npm-check-updates
ncu -u
npm install
```

If there is any issues with dependencies run `npm install --force` Don't worry too much about vulnerabilities, npm is buggy that way and also this is a sample project and you won't be using it for more than a portfolio showing.
