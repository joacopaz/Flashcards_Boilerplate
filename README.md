# Flashcards BoilerPlate

To install just run npm install, the package is up to dae with react router dom v6 and the files correctly adapted up to October 2022.

To get the current updated version of all packages up to the date you will be using this project run the command below

´´´
npm i -g npm-check-updates
ncu -u
npm install
´´´

If there is any issues with dependencies run npm install --force. Don't worry too much about vulnerabilities, npm is buggy that way and also this is a sample project and you won't be using it for more than a portfolio showing.
